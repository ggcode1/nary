# nary
Nary stands for "Nary is a Rusty Yarn"

Experimental JavaScript package installer to see what writing one in Rust could be like.

Current goals are:
 * Focus on security and error handling at all possible failure points
 * Creating the traditional nested directory hierarchy (not particularly interested in flattening, yet)
 * Not focued on installation performance, yet (yarn is much faster for now)

It is mostly experimental for now. It does kind of work though.
